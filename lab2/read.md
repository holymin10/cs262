a. The main component function returns a View component that contains several nested components that include: Container View, Image Container View, Footer Container View that contains two Buttons (Choose a photo, Use this photo) It also contains a StatusBar.

b. Some key values and benefits of using core components include: Cross-Platform Consistency, Performance Optimization, Simplicity and Convenience, Consistency with React Native Design Patterns, Reduced Learning Curve, Community and Documentation, and Integration with React Native Ecosystem.

c. Although React Native uses JavaScript to handle styling the core principles of styling seem similar to CSS.

d. Curly braces ({}) are used to embed JavaScript expressions within the JSX markup. Curly braces allow you to insert JavaScript values, expressions, or variables inside JSX to dynamically render content or values.

e. The purpose of asynchronous (async) methods in JavaScript, like pickImageAsync in our codee, is to handle operations that take time to complete (such as fetching data from a server or accessing a file system) without blocking the rest of the program from running. This improves the responsiveness of applications by allowing them to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the long-running operation to finish.

f. Yes, this application code does use hooks, specifically the useState hook. This is to manage the state of the selected image in a functional component, which updates dynamically as the user interacts with the image picker.

g. One example of an anonymous function in our code is async which is contained in pickImageAsync.
